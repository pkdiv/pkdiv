## Engineering Philosophy

I approach systems as attack surfaces and failure domains, not just deployments.

My work focuses on:
- Designing systems that fail safely
- Reducing blast radius through isolation and least privilege
- Automating away human error
- Making architecture decisions explicit and reviewable

I am actively transitioning into Security Architecture and SRE roles, with hands-on experience across automation, cloud, and systems engineering.

## Security and Reliability Focus

- Threat modeling and risk analysis
- Trust boundaries and privilege separation
- Secure CI/CD pipeline design
- Secrets management and pipeline isolation
- Failure analysis and reliability safeguards
- Observability-aware automation

## Tooling and Platforms

Tools are treated as implementation details, not architecture.

## Writing and Design Notes

I write about topics I find interesting while working with computers, focusing on systems, automation, and practical learning.

Medium: https://medium.com/@pkdiv

---

## Learning Roadmap

Current focus:
- Security architecture fundamentals
- Threat modeling techniques
- Secure automation patterns

Next focus:
- Cloud-native security design
- Platform and multi-tenant architecture
- SRE practices such as SLOs, error budgets, and failure modeling

---

## Professional Interests

I am interested in discussions around:
- Secure system design
- Reliability engineering
- Architecture tradeoffs
- Preventive approaches to incidents

If you are building systems where security and uptime are first-class concerns, I am open to connecting.
